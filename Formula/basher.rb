  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      To make basher work smoothly, link it to your home directory
        ln -s /usr/local/opt/basher ~/.basher

      Add `basher init` to your shell to enable basher runtime functions
        echo 'eval "$(basher init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

      For Fish, use the following line on your ~/.config/fish/config.fish.
        status --is-interactive; and . (basher init -|psub)
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system bin/"basher", "commands"
  end
